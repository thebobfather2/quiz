# Password Generator Tool

## About Password Generator
Password Generator is a tool built for the Module 3 assignment for Georgia Tech's Full Stack Boot Camp. The tool allows users to specify criteria to be included in a randomly generated password between 8-128 characters, and then displays the generated password to the user.

## Instructions
<ol>
  <li>You will be prompted to specify how many characters you want your password to be! This number must be between 8-128 characters.</li>
  <li>Using 1 for lowercase, 2 for uppercase, 3 for numeric, and 4 for special characters, please select your password criteria. NOTE: To select multiple critera, do     NOT use spaces and list the criteria identifiers in order from least to greatest.
